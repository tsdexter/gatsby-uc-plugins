Transfer browned meat onto a large plate.\n\nPlace the pot back in the pressure cooker and add onions and garlic and sauté for a minute or two then add the balsamic vinegar and tomato paste until just hot enough to deglaze the pot, about 1 minute.\n\nAdd the beef back into the pot along with potatoes, sweet potato, carrots, celery, seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, broth, bay leaf (star anise if using) and stir to combine. If there is not enough liquid to cover the vegetables, add water - only as much as needed.\n\nAdd the lid on the Instant Pot and set to 20 minutes with High Pressure on Manual mode. Allow the pressure cooker to release naturally for at least 15 minutes. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper if necessary (discard star anise if used). Serve hot with fresh parsley.\n\n**Optional: To thicken stew: Make a slurry by whisking 2 tablespoons of cool water with tablespoons cornstarch or flour (all purpose, gluten free or arrowroot powder).

Meanwhile prepare an olive tapenade but combining the olives, garlic, and Garlic Grapeseed Oil; set aside. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board, slice into strips for serving. Enjoy on a tortilla with the olive tapenade, hummus, tomatoes, and roasted red peppers.",

        "Directions": "Heat a large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add diced bacon and cook until crispy, stirring occasionally.  Transfer the bacon to a separate plate, using a slotted spoon, reserving about 3 tablespoons of bacon grease in the stockpot.  (Discard any extra grease, or you can substitute butter in place of the 3 tablespoons of bacon grease.  Also, if you are short on time, you can dice the potatoes and onion while the bacon cooks to save time.)\n\n\nAdd onion and saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft.  Sprinkle the flour on top of the onion, and stir until combined.  Saute for an additional minute to cook the flour, stirring occasionally.  Then stir in the chicken stock until combined.  Stir in the milk and potatoes until combined.  Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer, but is not boiling.\n\nReduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for about 10-15 minutes or until the potatoes are soft, stirring occasionally every few minutes so that the bottom does not burn.  (The smaller you dice your potatoes, the faster they will cook.)\n\nWhen the potatoes are soft, stir in the cheddar cheese and Greek yogurt (or sour cream), salt, pepper and cooked bacon bits.  Taste and see if it needs more salt or pepper or cheese.\n\nServe warm, garnished with desired toppings.  Or, transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.",

        "Directions": "1) In a heavy bottomed skillet (I like to use my cast iron), heat 2 tbsp of olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the potatoes to the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Fry until golden brown and cooked through, around 8-10 minutes, stirring a few times to ensure even browning.  \n2) In a separate skillet, brown the sliced kielbasa for around 5 minutes in 1 tbsp of olive oil over medium high heat.  Remove the kielbasa from the pan and set aside.  Add the peppers and onions to the skillet and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.  Cook for 5 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally.  \n3) Add the cooked potatoes and kielbasa to the skillet with the onions and peppers and mix everything together.  Serve nice and hot!\n\nNotes:\nI use two skillets to make this recipe.  I used to make it in one, but something always came out wrong.  I've learned that when I cook my potatoes in a separate skillet they cook more evenly and stay nice any crispy when they're added to the other ingredients right before serving.\nSometimes I'll add some minced garlic to the peppers and onions, but it tastes just as good without it.",

        "Ingredients": "4 skinless boneless chicken breasts\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 Tablespoon olive oil\n1 cup chicken broth (I recommend reduced sodium)\n1 Tablespoon fresh lime juice (I use closer to 1.5 Tbsp)\n1/4 cup finely chopped onion\n1 Tablespoon chopped cilantro\n1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n3 Tablespoons heavy cream\n2 Tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed\noptional: lime wedges and more cilantro for garnish, steamed asparagus for serving",
        "Directions": "Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).\n\n\nIf the chicken breasts are uneven in thickness, pound them down so they're all even. This way all the breasts will cook through similtaneously. Sprinkle each with salt and pepper.\n\nIn a large ovenproof skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 6-7 minutes, turning once. You want the chicken nice and browned on the outside. (It doesn't have to be cooked all the way through yet.) Set chicken on a plate and cover tightly with foil until step 5.\n\nRemove skillet from heat and add the broth, lime juice, onion, cilantro, and red pepper. Return to heat. Cook and stir to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Bring to a boil. Allow to boil gently, uncovered, for 10 minutes or until the liquid is reduced to around 1/4 cup. (During this time you can steam some veggies to have on the side, like asparagus.) Reduce heat to medium-low, then add the cream and butter. Stir until butter has melted.\n\nAdd chicken to the sauce and place the skillet in the preheated oven. Bake uncovered until the chicken is completely cooked through, about 5-10 minutes.\n\nServe chicken with sauce spooned on top and any of the listed optional garnishes. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for a few days. Reheat to your liking.",

Then, add the broth, 2 1/2 cups of milks (or cream/half and half), herbs, salt and pepper, and bring to a very low simmer (lower the heat if you need to). \n\nAdd the dry macaroni and stir occasionally as it comes to a simmer. Reduce heat down to medium low and stir regularly while it cooks (for about 9 - 10 minutes), or until the sauce thickens and the macaroni is just cooked (al dente: tender but still firm). Add the spinach and stir through until wilted. \n\nTake the pot off the stove and stir all of the cheese in quickly. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. If the sauce it too thick, add the remaining 1/2 cup milk (or cream) in 1/4 cup increments, until reaching desired thickness. Keep in mind the sauce will continue to thicken as it cools. \n\nSlice the chicken into strips and stir through the pasta (pour in any juices left from the chicken).
